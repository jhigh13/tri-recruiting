# Advanced TFRRS Data Collection Options

## Option 2A: Enhanced Selenium with Stealth Techniques

### Pros:
- Could potentially bypass some anti-bot measures
- Automated once working
- Can handle JavaScript-heavy pages

### Cons:
- Still likely to be detected by CloudFlare
- Requires significant setup (residential proxies are expensive)
- Higher risk of IP bans
- Complex to maintain

### Implementation Approach:
```python
# Enhanced Selenium with stealth
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
import time
import random

# Stealth configuration
options = Options()
options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
options.add_argument('--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled')
options.add_experimental_option("excludeSwitches", ["enable-automation"])
options.add_experimental_option('useAutomationExtension', False)

# Rotate user agents
user_agents = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
]
options.add_argument(f'--user-agent={random.choice(user_agents)}')

driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
driver.execute_script("Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {get: () => undefined})")
```

### Required Tools:
- Residential proxy service ($50-200/month)
- Stealth browser extensions
- CAPTCHA solving service
- VPN rotation

### Success Probability: 30-50% (CloudFlare is sophisticated)

## Option 2B: JSON API Approach

### Investigation Results:
After analyzing TFRRS, they do use JSON endpoints, but they're protected by:
- Dynamic tokens
- Request signing
- Rate limiting
- Same CloudFlare protection

### Example JSON Endpoints:
```
https://www.tfrrs.org/api/v1/lists/{list_id}/athletes.json
```

### Challenges:
- Tokens expire quickly
- Requires reverse engineering their JavaScript
- Still blocked by anti-bot protection

### Success Probability: 20-30%

## Option 2C: Browser Extension Approach

### Concept:
Create a browser extension that:
1. User manually navigates to TFRRS pages
2. Extension auto-extracts data
3. Sends to local server/saves to files

### Pros:
- Uses real browser session
- No anti-bot detection
- Semi-automated

### Cons:
- Requires browser extension development
- User must still manually navigate
- Chrome Web Store approval needed for distribution

### Success Probability: 80-90%

## Option 3: Alternative Data Sources (Recommended)

### 3A: NCAA.com Direct Access
```
Base URL: https://www.ncaa.com/stats/track-field/d1
```
- Often has less aggressive protection
- Official NCAA data
- Better structured

### 3B: College Athletic Websites
- Individual school results pages
- Often no anti-bot protection
- High-quality data

### 3C: MileSplit / Athletic.net
- Alternative track databases
- May have different protection levels
- Some data overlap with TFRRS

### 3D: USATF Database
```
https://www.usatf.org/resources/statistics
```
- National level competitions
- Less protection typically

## Recommendation Priority

### 1. Manual HTML Collection (Start Immediately)
**Effort**: Low | **Success**: 100% | **Time**: 2-3 hours for 50+ pages
- Start collecting data today
- Process with existing HTML processor
- Builds dataset while exploring other options

### 2. NCAA.com Investigation (Parallel Development)
**Effort**: Medium | **Success**: 70% | **Time**: 1-2 days
- Test if NCAA.com has better access
- Similar data quality to TFRRS
- Could replace TFRRS entirely

### 3. Browser Extension (If Manual Becomes Tedious)
**Effort**: High | **Success**: 90% | **Time**: 1 week
- Automates the manual process
- Still uses real browser
- Good long-term solution

### 4. Enhanced Selenium (Last Resort)
**Effort**: Very High | **Success**: 30% | **Time**: 1-2 weeks
- Expensive (proxy costs)
- High maintenance
- May get blocked anyway

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Today**: Start manual HTML collection for 10-20 key pages
2. **This week**: Investigate NCAA.com as alternative source
3. **Next week**: Consider browser extension if manual is too slow
4. **Avoid**: Expensive proxy/stealth solutions until other options exhausted
