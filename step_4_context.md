# Step 4: TFRRS Scraper Implementation - Context Summary

## Overview
Step 4 aimed to create a web scraper to collect NCAA Division I track athlete data from TFRRS (Track & Field Results Reporting System) and store it in the database for talent identification matching.

## What Was Completed ‚úÖ

### 1. Configuration System Created
- **File**: `config/events.yaml`
- **Features**:
  - Event mappings for outdoor (800m, 1500m, 3000m SC, 5000m, 10000m) and indoor (800m, Mile, 3000m, 5000m) events
  - Event IDs, display names, and performance time validation bounds
  - URL patterns for TFRRS list construction
  - CSS selectors for HTML parsing
  - Scraping configuration (rate limiting, timeouts, max athletes)
  - Years to scrape (2021-2025)

### 2. Complete TFRRS Scraper Implementation
- **File**: `etl/scrape_tfrrs.py`
- **Features**:
  - Class-based scraper with comprehensive error handling
  - Time parsing for track performance formats (MM:SS.ss ‚Üí decimal seconds)
  - Athlete name normalization and data validation
  - Database integration with SQLAlchemy upsert logic using `session.merge()`
  - Command-line interface with argument parsing
  - Progress tracking and summary statistics
  - Both requests/BeautifulSoup and Selenium support for JavaScript-rendered pages
  - Configurable rate limiting and timeout handling

### 3. Bug Fixes Applied
- Fixed indentation issue in `verify_step3.py` line 70
- Removed Unicode emojis from logging to prevent Windows encoding errors
- Added Selenium imports and headless browser support

## Challenges Encountered ‚ùå

### 1. TFRRS URL Structure Issues
**Problem**: The URLs we constructed didn't return athlete data tables.

**URLs Tested**:
- Original: `https://tf.tfrrs.org/lists/5018/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_List#event12`
- Corrected: `https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/5018/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_List`

**Findings**:
- Both static requests (BeautifulSoup) and dynamic rendering (Selenium) found 0 tables
- Pages load successfully (200 status) but contain no tabular data
- Content appears to be dynamically loaded or requires specific interactions

### 2. HTML Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: Our CSS selectors expect `table.tablesaw` but no tables exist on the pages.

**Current Selectors** (may need updating):
```yaml
selectors:
  results_table: "table.tablesaw"
  result_rows: "tbody tr"
  athlete_name: "td:nth-child(2) a"
  school: "td:nth-child(3)"
  performance: "td:nth-child(4)"
```

## Current Code State

### Configuration Ready
The `config/events.yaml` is comprehensive and easily updatable once correct URL patterns are determined.

### Scraper Architecture Sound
The scraper code in `etl/scrape_tfrrs.py` has solid architecture:
- Handles both static and JavaScript-rendered content
- Robust error handling and logging
- Database integration working
- Time parsing and validation logic complete
- Command-line interface functional

### Database Schema Ready
The `Runner` model in `db/models.py` is ready to receive athlete data with all necessary fields.

## Recommendations for Next Session üîß

### 1. URL Investigation Priority
**Action Needed**: Get working TFRRS URLs that actually contain athlete data.

**Questions to Answer**:
- What's the correct URL structure for individual events?
- Do we need to navigate through the main list page to access event-specific data?
- Are there API endpoints we should use instead of scraping HTML?
- What parameters (if any) are needed to show 500 athletes per event?

**Suggested Testing**:
```bash
# Test these URL patterns:
https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/5018/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_List?event=800m
https://www.tfrrs.org/list_data/5018?event_id=12
https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/5018/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_List/800m
```

### 2. HTML Structure Analysis
**Action Needed**: Once working URLs are found, inspect the actual HTML structure.

**Tasks**:
- Identify correct CSS selectors for athlete tables/lists
- Determine if data is in `<table>` elements or other structures (divs, lists)
- Check if results require JavaScript interaction (clicking buttons, pagination)
- Update `config/events.yaml` selectors accordingly

### 3. Quick Testing Script
**Recommended Approach**: Create a minimal test script to validate URLs before running full scraper:

```python
# Quick test script idea
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def test_tfrrs_url(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    
    print(f"URL: {url}")
    print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Tables: {len(soup.find_all('table'))}")
    print(f"Athletes found: {len(soup.select('a[href*=\"athlete\"]'))}")
    print("---")

# Test multiple URL patterns
urls_to_test = [
    "https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/5018/2025_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_List",
    # Add other patterns here
]
```

### 4. Alternative Data Sources
**Fallback Options** if TFRRS proves difficult:
- Check if TFRRS has a documented API
- Look for NCAA.com track results pages
- Consider USTFCCCA (coaches association) results databases
- Explore college-specific athletics websites

### 5. Implementation Validation
**Once URLs work**: Test the complete pipeline:
```bash
# Test small sample first
python etl/scrape_tfrrs.py --year 2025 --season outdoor --event 800m

# Verify data in database
python -c "from db.models import Runner; from db.db_connection import get_db_session; print(f'Athletes: {get_db_session().query(Runner).count()}')"
```

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies Confirmed Working
- ‚úÖ `pyyaml` installed and functioning
- ‚úÖ `selenium` 4.26.1 with Chrome WebDriver working
- ‚úÖ Database connection established
- ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy models ready

### Key Files Modified
1. `config/events.yaml` - Complete event configuration
2. `etl/scrape_tfrrs.py` - Full scraper implementation with Selenium support
3. `verify_step3.py` - Fixed indentation bug

### Next Steps Priority Order
1. **URGENT**: Get working TFRRS URLs with actual athlete data
2. Update `url_patterns` in `config/events.yaml`
3. Update CSS `selectors` in `config/events.yaml`
4. Test scraper with small sample
5. Validate data quality and proceed to Step 5 (SwimCloud scraper)

## Success Criteria for Step 4 Completion
- [ ] Scraper successfully fetches athlete data from TFRRS
- [ ] At least 50 athletes stored in database from test run
- [ ] Performance times properly parsed and validated
- [ ] No critical errors in scraping pipeline
- [ ] Data ready for Step 5 matching against swimmers
